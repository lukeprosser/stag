            <h2>Gentlemen</h2>
            <p>First of all I want to say a massive thank you to everyone who can make it to my stag. It's set to be a weekend I'll never forget and I really appreciate it.</p>
            <p>I know stag dos can cost an arm and a leg so we've tried to create a flexible weekend that everyone can enjoy at minimal cost.</p>

            <h2>The Location</h2>
            <p>The weekend centers around the picturesque market town of Llandeilo, West Wales.</p>
            <p>Surrounded by rolling hills and historic sites, it features everything we need for an enjoyable stay.</p>
            <p>There are plenty of pubs, coffee shops and bakeries to keep us fueled throughout.</p>

          <img src="img/cottages.jpg" alt="">
          <div class="container">
            <h2>Accommodation</h2>
            <p>The majority of us will be staying at <strong><a href="http://www.rhiannyddscottages.co.uk/" target="_blank">Rhiannydds Cottages</a></strong> up in the hills above Llangadog, a short drive away from Llandeilo.</p>
            <p>We're able to stay at the cottages for up to 3 nights, including Friday night, Saturday night and Sunday night.</p>
            <p>There is a large games room on site and hot tub, so <strong>bring trunks and a towel!</strong></p>
            <hr>
            <p>A number of adventurers are staying in <strong><a href="http://www.whitehartinnwales.co.uk/" target="_blank">The White Hart Inn</a></strong> just outside the main town, so they have a much easier trip to the pub!</p>

              <h2>The Plan</h2>
              <p>Not everyone can make it across the whole weekend, so I put together a guide schedule so that we're all on the same page.</p>
              <p>Hopefully everyone will have a decent idea of where we'll be and where they can tag along where relevant.</p>

            <h2>What To Bring</h2>
            <p>For optimal chances of survival, you will need the following:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Wallet</strong> - There are cash points in Llandeilo but I recommend grabbing some handy dollar before you head out.</li>
              <li><strong>Phone</strong> - Signal is intermittent in the wilderness but there's net in the town and phones are a lifeline in case of emergencies (and selfies).</li>
              <li><strong>Food & drink for Friday night</strong> - We'll be doing a supply run on Friday afternoon but be sure to bring any beers and food that you want to consume, and any extra snacks to keep you going throughout the weekend.</li>
              <li><strong>Trunks and towel for the hot tub</strong> - As mentioned, if you're staying at the cottages there is a hot tub for us to use.</li>
              <li><strong>Rugged clothes for Saturday activities</strong> - Items you don't mind getting mucky as heck. They'll provide us with overalls but don't wear anything you care about. I'll be taking my usual hiking kit i.e. walking boots, waterproof bottoms, sport t-shirt, overlay, waterproof jacket. If you don't have outdoor gear, old clothes, trainers, jeans etc. will be fine.</li>
              <li><strong>Smart-casual clothes for Saturday night</strong> - Polo / casual shirt + jeans will be fine.</li>
              <li><strong>Hiking clothes for Sunday</strong> - Again, some outdoor clothes that you don't mind getting a bit muddy/wet if the weather turns. I highly recommend some broken-in walking boots (blisters are a classic new-boot situation) but trainers will be ok as long as you don't mind wet feet.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Overall, we're out in the country so it's a relaxed, casual vibe.</p>
