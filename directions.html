            <h2>Dulais Valley Quads & Archery</h2>
            <h4>Nant-Y-Cafn farm, Seven Sisters, SA10 9EU</h4>
            <p>The quad and archery centre is located on Nant-Y-Cafn farm in Seven Sisters.</p>
            <p>Apparently the farm is a little awkward to locate, so I've provided directions below:</p>

            <h3>From Cardiff</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Get onto the M4 and head west (passing Bridgend and Port Talbot) until you reach Junction 43.</li>
              <li>Leave the M4 at J43. At the roundabout, take the 3rd exit heading north on the A465, signposted Neath and Merthyr Tydfil (if travelling on the M4 from the west exit M4 at J43, take 1st exit at roundabout onto A465).</li>
              <li>Follow the dual carriageway for approx 2-3 miles, then take the slip road signposted for Seven Sisters and Aberdulais Falls - this is the A4109.</li>
              <li>Stay on this road for approx 5-6 miles, through the village of Crynant and on into the village of Seven Sisters.</li>
              <li>As you come into the village of Seven Sisters, you enter a 30 mph zone. You will see a row of semi-detached houses on your left, followed by detached red brick houses which are slightly below the road.</li>
              <li>Take the right-hand turn (be careful as it's easy to miss) opposite the red brick houses, which is a single track lane (DO NOT go up Brynteg Street, this is not the road that leads to the farm).</li>
              <li>Follow the single track lane travelling uphill until you reach the farm. You will cross a railway crossing – you will need to use the telephone to cross.</li>
              <li>After you’ve crossed, follow the track to the left, then right into the farm.</li>
              <li>Park on the left just before the barn.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>From Brecon</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Take the A40 out of Brecon heading South towards Swansea.</li>
              <li>Stay on the A40 (passing Llanspyddid) until you come to a village called Sennybridge (approx 8 miles from Brecon).</li>
              <li>Just before Sennybridge you will see a left turn signposted for Ystradgynlais and Swansea. Take this turning which is the A4067.</li>
              <li>Follow this road for approx 15 miles. You will go through a small village called Cray.</li>
              <li>Pass a reservoir on your right, pass Craig-Y-Nos castle on your left, and go through the villages of Pen-Y-Cae and Ynyswen.</li>
              <li>Approx ½ a mile after Ynyswen you will see a left-hand turn signposted Glynneath. Take this turning which is on the A4221.</li>
              <li>Follow this road up a hill. As the road flattens out, take the next right turning signposted Onllwyn.</li>
              <li>Follow this road for quarter of a mile passing a Washery on your left. You'll then come to a junction - turn right and follow the road into Seven Sisters.</li>
              <li>When you see a Costcutter shop in front of you on the right, go straight down the hill to the junction (with a church opposite).</li>
              <li>Turn left at the junction and follow the road for approx half a mile. You’ll pass a football field on the left, and a service garage & golf driving range on the right.</li>
              <li>Approx 250 yards after the driving range take the 3rd left turning which is onto a narrow lane.</li>
              <li>Follow the lane uphill until you reach the railway crossing (you’ll need to use the telephone to cross).</li>
              <li>Once you’ve crossed, follow the track to the left, then to the right and you’re in the farm (park on the left before the barn).</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>From the East on the A465 from Merthyr</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>Leave the A465 at Glynneath on to the A4109 to Seven Sisters.</li>
              <li>Travel straight through the village of Seven Sisters.</li>
              <li>Pass a golf driving range on your right-hand side.</li>
              <li>Take the 3rd turning left after the driving range - this will be a farm road, NOT a street.</li>
              <li>Follow the farm road to a railway crossing (the railway track is in use), cross the railway and follow the road on to the farm.<li>
              <li>The post code is SA10 9EU - if you are using satellite navigation it will direct you up Brynteg Road - DON'T take that road.</li>
              <li>You will want the Nant-y-Cafn Farm road which is the turning after it.</li>
              <li>Park on the left just before the barn.</li>
            </ol>
